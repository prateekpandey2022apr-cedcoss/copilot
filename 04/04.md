Once a function is written, copilot will suggest the docstring for the function (line by line).

We can create the docstring at once using an extension called [Copilot labs](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-labs/).

There is a project called [Copilot for docs](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-docs), which allows the dev to view the internal or external documentation.

The main obective of Copilot for docs is to find the relevant documentation from one (or more sources) and stitch it together into a single answer.

**Copilot for docs is not yet publically available.**

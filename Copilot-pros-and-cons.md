Here are some of the pros and cons of copilot that I've encountered.

## Pros

- Given some context the copilot was able to generate the unit tests and integration tests appropriately.

- Copilot can be used to generate common patters in code. For, e.g:

  ```js
  const monts = [
    "JANUARY",
    "FEBRUARY",
    "MARCH",
    "APRIL",
    "MAY",
    "JUNE",
    "JULY",
    "AUGUST",
    "SEPTEMBER",
    "OCTOBER",
    "NOVEMBER",
    "DECEMBER",
  ];
  ```

- Generating utlity functions like random strings, converting date-time string into readable format.

- Copilot can generate opmitimized soltion to a common problems. For example: finding common elements between two arrays.

- Developers can select their level of expertise, familarity with a library and get personalized content on the fly.

- Perpetually updated content, written by the libraryâ€™s maintainers, and supports answers with citations in the original docs.

## Cons

- Suggested code may always be correct.

- Copilot doesn't test the suggested code.

- Bad coding practices may be propagated.

* You need to review the code thoroughly before you can accept it.
